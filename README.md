# DSYN-Public
D_Sync is a continuation of my Ludum Dare 40 project. 
The latest version can be downloaded at: https://github.com/Ziamor/DSYN-Public/releases/tag/v0.2-alpha
The current release is for desktop only but the final product will be on Android. I did not include the Android apk as you canâ€™t use the level editor on Android currently.
